#But there is one minor (*Major) problem, This compiler does not want you to execute this peice of code, because, well the app will crash, and mimo is not intelligent enough to tacle a three line code. (*No offence!)

#So I added a variable and assigned it a value, hence the compiler will execute the code without ðŸ’¥ing itself, even though it ðŸ’¥s itself if you plug even 10000 into the variable.

stop_the_bug = 10000
#My OG plan of plugging a value: 100000000000000000000000000000000000 (*One hundred Decellion.)
